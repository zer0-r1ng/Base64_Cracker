## Overview

As a CTFer, we may come across strings that go through many layers of Base encoding.And if we decode it manually, it will be very troublesome.So this is a tool to decode multi-layer Base64 encoding strings.

This is an example.

## ‰∫å„ÄÅAbout

I use these libraries for my development work.

```
base64
```

```
binascii
```

```
re
```

Please use this command to decode the base64 encoding strings.

```
python base64_cracker.py
```

Then input the strings to decode.
